# inner product distance benchmark

A benchmark for functions running inner product distance computations.

## TODO

- adjust ip_blas complexity (RMS is 10%)
- think about warmup iterations
- multi-vector distance computation
- add manually vectorized implementations
- idea: use stride for multi-vector calculations
